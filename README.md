# Exploratory Data Analysis in R: Course Evaluations, Bike Sharing & More
### Overview
This project showcases data analysis and visualization techniques using R. The datasets cover topics like course evaluations, bike-sharing trends, and music streaming data. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), I apply statistical methods and visualizations to uncover insights.

### Key Skills Demonstrated
Data wrangling and cleaning with tidyverse
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Data visualization using ggplot2
Statistical summarization and hypothesis testing
### Datasets Analyzed
Course Evaluations – Analyzing student feedback trends
Bike Sharing – Examining usage patterns over time
Music Streaming – Investigating song popularity and trends
### Tools & Libraries
R (Tidyverse, ggplot2, dplyr, readr)
RMarkdown for reproducible analysis
### How to Run
Clone the repository and run the R scripts or RMarkdown files in an R environment with the required packages installed.
